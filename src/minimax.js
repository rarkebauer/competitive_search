The function "makeMove" is already written for you.

Output: Returns an integer indicating the column
where the piece will be dropped.

You must write the function "heuristic".

Input: state, maximizingPlayer.  The state will be
a state object.  The maximizingPlayer will be either
an 'x' or an 'o', and is the player whose advantage
is signified by positive numbers.

Output: A number evaluating how good the state is from
the perspective of the player who is maximizing.

A VERY USEFUL method on state here would be state.numLines.
This function takes an integer and a player
like this "state.numLines(2,'x')" and returns the
number of lines of that length which that player
has.  That is, it returns the number of contiguous linear
pieces of that length that that player has.

You'll want to pass the tests defined in minimax_specs.js.

Input: state, depth, maximizingPlayer.  The state is
an instance of a state object.  The depth is an integer
greater than zero; when it is zero, the minimax function
should return the value of the heuristic function.

Output: Returns a number evaluating the state, just
like heuristic does.

You'll need to use state.nextStates(), which returns
a list of possible successor states to the state passed in
as an argument.

You'll also probably need to use state.nextMovePlayer,
which returns whether the next moving player is 'x' or 'o',
to see if you are maximizing or minimizing.
